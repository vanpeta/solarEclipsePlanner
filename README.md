# Solar Eclipse Planner

Solar Eclipse Planner is an app that will help you to plan your trip to witness the 2017 solar eclipse in the US, the also called American Eclipse.

By providing a map to the user, he/she will be able to give any coordinates and the app will provide with entries from airbnb nearby that location.

Finally the user can save the airbnb houses that is most interested in and check them out later.
